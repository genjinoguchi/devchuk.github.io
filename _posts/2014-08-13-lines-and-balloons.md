So on the day after I got home from [BattleHacks Boston](https://2014.battlehack.org/boston) where we built [Lineless](http://devchuk.github.io/portfolio/software/lineless.html), my friend Yaseen asked me if I happened to be free for the rest of the week.

It turns out that the company he interned in, [Kite & Rocket](http://kiteandrocket.com/), needed some help launching a phone via balloons and taking a livestream through the phone's camera. What's even more ridiculous about this thing is that I would actually be paid for this. So I said something alone the lines of "..yes of course" and now I'm currently 3D printing case parts (the photo above is an example) for the Android phone we'll be launching. The launch date will be on this Friday, 8/15, and I'll post up a [project](http://devchuk.github.io/portfolio/miscellaneous/balloon.html) with a procedure in my portfolio page later if anyone is interested in doing the same thing.
