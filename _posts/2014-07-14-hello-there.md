Hello and welcome to my personal website. I'm Brian Chuk, the designer and programmer of this website. I'll be using this website for blog posts, collections of things I've done, and other important information.

If you're interested in looking at the source code, you can view it [here](https://github.com/devChuk/devchuk.github.io).

I'd like to give credit to the tools I used to create this website:

-The header autohide function is created with [Headroom.js](http://wicky.nillia.ms/headroom.js/).<br>
-I based my main.css off of [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).<br>
-Redcarpet parsing for the static blog is created with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).<br>
-Colors were chosen with [Please.js](http://www.checkman.io/please).<br>
-[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) offers fantastic fonts.<br>
-[Brace Forms](http://forms.brace.io/) has helped a ton with the contact page.<br>
-Form CSSing from [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/forms/).
-[MixItUp](https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/) for an incredible sorting plugin for the portfolio page.<br>
