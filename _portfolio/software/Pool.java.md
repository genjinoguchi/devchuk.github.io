Pool.java is a game I made with [Patrick](http://www.patosai.com/) during the second [Codeday Hackathon](http://codeday.org/ny) of 2014. It features a physics engine in Java to simulate the reflections and movements of billiards balls and algorithms that follow billiard rules and determine the winner.
