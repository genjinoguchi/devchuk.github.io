This website you are on as of right now has been designed and programmed by me. It's probably the biggest web project I've ever done so far, and I've learned so much from it. The website features a Jekyll-powered blog with advertisements for charity, a portfolio page showcasing all the notable projects I've worked on, an about page with some sweet jQuery animations, a contact page with a working form, an archive that stores every blog post I've ever written, and a home page that ties everything together.

As I added my past projects to the portfolio page, I was stunned by all the things I've done. The projects I've had a chance to work one were projects that I would have never even thought I would have worked on, and all I can say is that I'm thankful for the people I've met who made me the way I am today. I'm also excited for the future because I know things are going to get even better. :)

Thanks for visiting my website!
