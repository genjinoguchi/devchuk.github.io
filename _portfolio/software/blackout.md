For [HackNYU](http://patentpendingnyu.org/2-uncategorised/14-hack-nyu-hackathon), I teamed up with (Timotius)[http://timsitorus.com/], (Victor)[http://vjiaoblack.github.io/], and (Genji)[http://genjinoguchi.github.io/] to build Blackout.
<br><br>
Blackout is a stealth multiplayer game made with our own Java game engine between computers where players find themselves in a dark room with a flashlight and a knife. Each player is only able to see the other players by pointing the flashlight at them with the mouse. The objective of the game is to eliminate the others by stabbing them and be the last person standing. It uses Java sockets in order to support multiplayer, so theoretically you can have as many players as you want as long as the computer that is hosting the server can handle it. The game feaatures an original, detailed background, platforms to jump and sneak on, animated sprites, and stabbing and turning delays for game balance and difficulty.
