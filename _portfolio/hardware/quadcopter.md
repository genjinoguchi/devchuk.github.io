After the robot arm project, a friend and I started the quadcopter project. The many uses and abilities of UAVs fascinated me so I decided to try to understand them by building one from scratch.

We used a carbon fiber frame, an Arduino Mega microcontroller, a Q Brain Quadruple ESC, four brushless motors, a battery, a gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer in order to create our quadcopter.
